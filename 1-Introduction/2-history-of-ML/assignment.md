# Create a timeline

## Instructions

Using [this repo](https://github.com/Digital-Humanities-Toolkit/timeline-builder), create a timeline of some aspect of the history of algorithms, mathematics, statistics, AI, or ML, or a combination of these. You can focus on one person, one idea, or a long timespan of thought. Make sure to add multimedia elements.

#### my note
start from alan turing, john mcarthy and co, then go to the algorithms, then go to the applications that were developed including expert systems, then go to what we have now and the challenges we face with deep learning.

| ALAN TURING | 1950 | Turing test                  | In 1950, Turing was thinking of computers that were intelligent,  he proposed a test that if a computer can pass then the machine  or computer is said to be intelligent. The name of the test is  the IMITATION GAME. The game is like this; an interrogator will stand behind a wall and interview a man and a woman, if the interrogator cannot tell who is the machine and who is human, then the computer is said to be turing complete.  He proposed that by the year 2000, this kind of computers would available. Although his prediction did not pan out that way, he  however set a sort of benchmark for when other scientist or programmers can tell when a computer is intelligent.  This test has also been subject to critism by other scientist, that it cannot be a benchmark because it only recognizes problem solving, it does not consider other forms of intelligence such as abilities requiring perceptual skill or  manual dexterity (the ability to use your hands in a skillful way) |              |

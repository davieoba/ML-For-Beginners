# Create a timeline

## Instructions

Using [this repo](https://github.com/Digital-Humanities-Toolkit/timeline-builder), create a timeline of some aspect of the history of algorithms, mathematics, statistics, AI, or ML, or a combination of these. You can focus on one person, one idea, or a long timespan of thought. Make sure to add multimedia elements.

#### my note
start from alan turing, john mcarthy and co, then go to the algorithms, then go to the applications that were developed including expert systems, then go to what we have now and the challenges we face with deep learning.
